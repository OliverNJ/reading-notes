## Introduction

My name is `Oliver Neitzel-Johnson` and this is what a growth mindset means to me. You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/OliverNJ).

## What Is A Growth Mindset?

A growth mindset is the process of taking in the situation you find yourself in and focusing on how to improve it overall. You want to focus on what you're doing now that you can improve on and not lingering on the faults you are finding with yourself or your work.

## Examples

We need for focus on how we can change a bad situation into a good situation.

> "I can't do this"

Above is a **bad** way to cope with a situation. You want to see what you are capable of and when you are stuck seek out help.

> "This is never going to work"

If you have difficulty figuring out what your next steps are, you should always _ask someone else_ what your point of focus should be.

## Things To Remember For The Future

There are some things to keep in mind when you are struggling:

1. See how far you can get with your work by yourself, don't beat yourself up if you get stuck.
2. When you get stuck, find some help. There is no shame in not knowing what to do.
3. Always be kind to yourself. If someone said the negative thoughts in your head outloud to you, how would you feel?
